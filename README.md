# An Oaks Event

This is to be software to coordinate an event. There are a variety of use cases currently under consideration:

## Mapping

## Reservations

## Bidding

## Festival

There is a field beside the Castle where a stage could be erected. I see the application interaction as:

1. Potential goers enter bands' email or twitter and the system sends them a request to place a bid.
2. Bands bid a duration and a price.
3. Users see bids and compose / edit schedules.
4. Goers reserve tickets for lineups.
5. Sales leader chosen as actual lineup.

## Dinner

Put tables in the ballroom and dining room. Allow participants to make reservations.

Participants could vote on the chef / menu with another bidding process.

Could exist in conjunction with the festival. The diner orders from food vendors, and it's delivered when ready.

## Hackathon

Use the upstairs offices to house work and meeting spaces to quickly build software.

## Lockers

Allow access to a bank of electronically secured lockers.

Allow users to transfer remaining rental time to other users.

## Dungeon

Allow organizations to reserve areas, and give them the capacity to review reservations during their tenure.

Have part of the basement be clothing optional..
