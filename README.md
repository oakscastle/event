# Oaks Management

This software is for collaboratively managing access to a space. The initial design centers on [the Oaks Castle](http://oakscastle.org) to fund its purchase for use as a public space.

## Use Cases

### Mapping

A user can view a [map of the Castle](http://oakscastle.github.io/map/) [which is dynamically generated](https://github.com/oakscastle/event/wiki/Area-%E2%9E%94-SVG).

A user can click on an area and view only it and its descendants.

### Floors

Areas can have exclusive children only one of which may be active at a time.

Users can see available floors and select between them via the map.

### Reservations

A user is able to view the availability of an area and create reservations.

### Dynamic Map

A slider allows the user to change the current time being viewed, and areas gray out when reserved.

### Events

Users are able transitory describe changes to area.

A wedding might have a dinner and the performance of a band.

When those events are taking place, they are displayed on the map.

### Tickets

An event has a specified number of reservations which may be claimed.

### Bidding

Artists and caterers bid to provide the aforementioned meal and music.

Users can view competing bids.

Planners can approve bids.

### Festival

An event defines a long interval, and artists bid durations of it.

Different tickets go on sale with prices based on the accepted performers bids.

Vendors could place "negative" bids to attend.

Users reserve however many tickets they desire. The first to pass a threshold becomes the actual event.

### Lockers

Allow access to a bank of electronically secured lockers.

Allow users to transfer remaining rental time to other users.

### Disputation

Allow competing events to be created and members vote on which take place.
